# uno
A simple uno game I am making in Java. Will add a python version later. 

Nah but seriously, this doesn't work right now, I gotta fix some of my Random codes so they all work. From there it will be a very basic game.

Game working!

Right now, you play as all 4 players. 

This is the chillhumanoid version of the game. 

#differences in versions:

actual rules state when you draw a card, you see if you can play a card, otherwise your turn ends. 
chillhumanoid rules are that when you draw a card, it's the next players turn.
