#Version History(newest first)
##0.0.5.1
fixed problem where it wouldn't allow multiple digit integers
##0.0.5.0
Most likely my last update before I add some form of AI. I fixed the draw pile. If it gets lower than 4 cards, it will take the discard pile and shuffle it and make it the draw pile. I also added a way for player to call uno themselves. if they call uno falsely, or they forget to call uno, it will result in a draw 2 penalty. 
##0.0.4.0
Drawing a card follows Uno rules. Now you can draw a card if you can't play any other card, then you can see if you can play that card
If you can't play that card the option for draw a card turns into "End Turn". The drawn card will be at spot 1. 
##0.0.3.0
Fixed problem where entering the wrong input results in game crash
Made it so you can type in just the first letter of the color you want to pick for wilds.
