##1.0.0.1 
I am an idiot. Fixed that. sorta.
##1.0.0.0
Fixed various problems, including an issue where changing the discard pile to draw pile dind't work 100%. In addition, when it did change the piles, it wouldn't change the wild cards back to "any". There is no more issue as far as I can tell on 100 simulations of one card ruling the world(all you could draw was the one card). Fixed an issue where if you entered a number too large, it broke the game.

Again, as far as I can tell, this is the final version of the command line version of the game. I do plan on creating it in other languages. My first goal is python. then C#. once i have c# I will create a GUI version of the game. I might do that with java but that is not a current priority. 

It's been fun. Thank you for watching my streams. If you notice any more bugs, please let me know.

##0.1.0.0
Got rid of mac version as my script did NOT work. Working AI.
##0.0.5.1
fixed problem where it wouldn't allow multiple digit integers
##0.0.5.0
Most likely my last update before I add some form of AI. I fixed the draw pile. If it gets lower than 4 cards, it will take the discard pile and shuffle it and make it the draw pile. I also added a way for player to call uno themselves. if they call uno falsely, or they forget to call uno, it will result in a draw 2 penalty. 
##0.0.4.0
Drawing a card follows Uno rules. Now you can draw a card if you can't play any other card, then you can see if you can play that card
If you can't play that card the option for draw a card turns into "End Turn". The drawn card will be at spot 1.
